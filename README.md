## Description

Computing encompasses imperative, autonomous, and cognitive technologies. Imperative computing follows programmed instructions on stored data, while autonomous computing makes independent decisions on procedural data. Cognitive computing mirrors human brain processes like reasoning and learning. It's advanced and not restricted to specific data, utilizing a web scraping approach.

Cognitive Computing aligns with Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 (8K), operating through tokenizationâ€”breaking prompts into units for processing. Tokenization varies, with tokens ranging from letters to words. LLMs like GPT-4 have an 8K token limit, beyond which context is lost.

To address this, Langchain uses a recursive model, breaking data into manageable chunks. These are converted into vectors and stored in Pinecone for semantic search. User prompts trigger refined data retrieval by LLMs, enhancing clarity. Flask APIs manage services like text-to-video, image, or summarization.

The web app's interface is user-friendly, featuring a responsive chat window for custom data interaction. Users can navigate content-specific pages for text, audio, image, and video inputs. Langchain ensures precise, custom data-based responses, overcoming token limitations.

## Technology stack

Tools and technologies that you learnt and used in the project.

1. NextJS
2. Langchain
3. Huggingface API
4. Python Flask
5. Pinecone
6. Firebase

## Project Setup

- For this project, you will have to install packages given in requirements.txt file in the repository, as well as u need openai api key (GPT-4 LLM) for langchain to process the textual documents and data of our application same goes for the output obtained and context length of the chat. The steps to do so are:
  > Clone our repository -> npm install command for NextJs frontend node modules -> pip install requirement.txt for flask backend -> if any package found missing just copy the package name and npm install of pip install it in respective codes
- Run the following commands in separate terminals:

  > For Frontend : npm run dev

  > For Backend : Python app.py

## Usage

- After setup, you can open the link provided for the localhost port.After that, you reach the login screen.
- You can login using your google account which will read your profile name, email, phone and photo and store them in the database as user data.
- Once logged in, you will see options of via text, image in the home page.
- You can choose to go to the chatbot in the AI chatbot tab
- Similarly you can also go to the image generation tab if you just want to generate an image
- for other file types like audio, video we have that functionality integrated in the AI chatbot itself no seperate tabs for that
- In AI chatbot, you can see the chat window in the user input textarea we have provided the options of uploading image, video, audio and text
- There are limitations of which individual type of respective inputs are accepted in our model

  > For Image : JPG, JPEG, PNG

  > For Audio : MP3

  > For Video : Youtube video links only (should be containing subtitles in english)

- Also TEXT-TO-IMAGE, just have to choose the option and enter the text in the same textarea and you will get the output in the chat window itself, and you can continue with the chat.

## Applications

- Content Curation, News Aggregation, Document Review
- Academic Research, Content Extraction
- Educational Learning, Business Intelligence Reports
- Face Recognition, Security & Surveillance
- Accessibility, Content Generation
- Visual Search, Tourism & Navigation
- Media & Entertainment, Interview Analysis
- Healthcare Services & Professionals

## Future scope

- The Future Scope of this application includes Generative AI functionality.
- Increasing the no of Format accepted by the model
  in each of the image, text, audio and videos.
- Scope of Adding online image, text, audio, video links
  as input.
- Addition of browsing facilities in a seperate panel, running parallel to chat-window of our application so that we can easily access external websites.
- Can train our own models for more faster response to the users
